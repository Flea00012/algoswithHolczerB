# Welcome to the repo for Graph Algorithms (course with Holzcer B) and Leetcode examples.

## The repo contains mostly java code but some Leetcode or other challenges could contain Go, Rust or Python.

You will therefore require the Rust compiler, Go compiler or Pyton interpreter installed to run the examples or just use a playground.

## I recommend Holzers courses on algos Udemy, He is a great instuctor and you will have lots of fun.
